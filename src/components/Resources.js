              The National Key Scheme (NKS), previously referred to as RADAR
              keys, offer disabled people independent access to locked public
              accessible toilets around the country. You can buy the key from
              Disability Rights UK either over the phone or through their
              website. Additionally, most local authorities have one-stop-shops
              or local charities that you can get them from. You will need to
              provide proof of your disability when buying one.
